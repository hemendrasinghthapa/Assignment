# Que18:- What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

# Ans:-

'''Tuple:- A tuple in Python is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. 
However, tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created
their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. '''

# Difference

# List is mutable , so, we can change it value we can perform append , pop operation 
# But , tuple is immutable so, we canâ€™t change it value 

# List is define by [] braces and tuple represent by () braces
